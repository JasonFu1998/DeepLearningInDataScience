@probablynoah Thats because they are players in the game of thrones only Daenerys, Brienne and Arya have capabilities for battle and out of those 3 only one truly holds power in the realm. Cersei has been a game player all of her life why would she change now especially since she has nothing.#

game of thrones was at its best in its first three or four seasons for the following reason it is much better at being about the petty, petulant politics of noblemen who cant prioritize the wellbeing of the world than it is about being about noblemen prioritizing the world#
this is pretty obvious to a lot of people but i think is worth saying out loud game of thrones is very impressive in a lot of ways but isnt masterpiece television at this point and at this point is only really a triumph of budget, excess, and branding#
before i say anything else i enjoy game of thrones and i think people should try to enjoy it! i sure do! but i think assessing its overall quality as a piece of television is difficult and interesting and worth thinking about!#
the most interesting game of thrones ever got, i contend, is when the most powerful people in the world are far more concerned with short term drama than those two worldchanging threads#
Im about to mute game of thrones i still have two seasons left to watch and Twitter keeps ruining it for me#

@laurakathryyn @gregprice11 @CalebJHull You cant separate the sex scenes from the art scenes. The entirety of game of thrones is the artistic piece. The sex scenes are part of that, and have a purpose that is inherently antithetical to pornography. The vast majority are designed to show how gross the worldpeople are.#
@StrangelandElf Most of the sexual content in game of thrones is not overshown or graphic. The vast majority of it is simple nudity with implied movementnotions based on background noises.#
@StrangelandElf The vast majority of sex scenes in game of thrones are meant to paint the characters engaging in the actions in a bad light. One of the most well liked characters on the show Tyrion likes prostitutes. He falls in love with a prostitute, and it ends up completely ruining his life.#
@StrangelandElf The intent of showing him with prostitutes, and his terrible life choices is not that whoring is good. In fact, most people in his life look down on that behavior.  
The vast majority of the sex that takes place in game of thrones views the act in a negative light, and it ends up#
